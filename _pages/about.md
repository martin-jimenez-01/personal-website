#### Howdy, I'm Martin Jimenez

I am a software developer specializing in machine learning applications and web applications. I continually seek to learn new and emerging methods which I find extremely important to machine learning since it is so quickly changing. Some of my favorite applications include working with non-profits in the arts. I've created an optical character recognition model that automates data entry from physical survey cards into their database. I've also developed a machine learning model that was then used to create an optimal geofence in the target market to run an advertising campaign.

##### Beyond The Professional

Beyond my professional life, I am a violinist and I currently play in a quartet casually and a trio that is rehearsing an _Interstellar Medley_ which I had arranged the music for. I also play semi-regularly for the local community theater.
